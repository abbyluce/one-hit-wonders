    "bio": "Bob Berryhill, Pat Connolly, Jim Fuller and Ron Wilson wrote 'Wipe Out' almost on the spot while at Pal Recording Studio in Cucamonga, California, in late 1962, when they realized they needed a suitable B-side for the intended 'Surfer Joe' single. One of the band members suggested introducing the song with a cracking sound, imitating a breaking surfboard, followed by a manic voice babbling, 'ha ha ha ha ha, wipe out'. The voice was that of the band's manager, Dale Smallin.",
